The GermanSolarFarm data set contains 21 photovoltaic facilities
in Germany. Their installed nominal power ranges between
100kW and 8500kW. The PV facilities range from PV panels
installed on rooftops to fully fledged solar farms. They are
distributed throughout Germany as shown in the attached image.
For each facility historical NWP data and the produced
power in a three-hour resolution for 990 days are available.
All time series in the data set, except the measured power
output, are normalized between 0 and 1 using the minmax
normalization. The target variable, the measured power
output, is normalized using the nominal output capacity of the
corresponding PV facility. Therefore, allow the comparison of
the forecasting performance without taking the size of the PV
facilities into account.
